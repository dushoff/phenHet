In early stages of spread, the reproductive number is given by R0. This can be thought of as a product of the average infectiousness of infectors, and the average susceptibility of susceptible individuals. And the proportion of the population susceptible. Not has the disease. As the disease spreads through the population, the effective reproductive number, arthur, declines typically declines from R0. Setting aside Behavioral or policy changes, there are still three main reasons for this decreasing infectiousness of the infected population, decreasing susceptibility of the susceptible population, and decreasing proportions susceptible in the population.

We are interested in the rate of this decrease, and for this purpose, we like to think about the ratio σ, which is defined as the ratio between arthur, and a naive value of Reff given by s Reff. In a homogeneous, well mixed model σ is one.

We are interested in functional forms sensible functional forms for σ in a variety of scenarios, in particular with or without accounting for: changes infection in the infected population, the discrete nature of contacts, and the local nature of mixing. So I guess this could give us up to eight different approaches. 

The Dwyer Parsons approach does not account for any of these three factors. It can be It can be derived either with a moment approximation, or via a gamma assumption. It is equivalent to σ equals something. The Add something about over dispersion to the paragraph above. Which I guess leaves us with 16 possibilities. The Novozhilov approach accounts for discrete contacts, but none of the other factors. The. Recently, Richard and Jonathan have come up with an approach that generalizes these two. So it is still focused only on changing susceptibility, and it's not addressing locality, which is very much in our future. I am particularly interested in we are particularly interested in mining more from the Miller approach, and seeing if we can come up with simple approaches that account for changing changes in both infectiousness and susceptibility. There are some dangers there are some difficulties here in terms of accounting for recovery.
