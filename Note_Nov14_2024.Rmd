# Phenominalogical Incidence with Network

We would like to investigate how to generate better interpretations or insights to nonlinear/phenomenological incidence $f(S,I)$(instead of $SI$) in compartmental epidemilogy model, using graph/network models for the social structure/heterogenity.

## Literatrue/Scoping Review

(TO DO) A good start point is to conduct a literature/scoping review.

### Papers/authors we know, but might biased.
