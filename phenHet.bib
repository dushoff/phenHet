  abstract = {While it is well established that host heterogeneity in transmission and host heterogeneity in susceptibility each individually impact disease dynamics in characteristic ways, it is generally unknown how disease dynamics are impacted when both types of heterogeneity are simultaneously present. Here we explore this question. We first conducted a systematic review of published studies from which we determined that the effects of correlations have been drastically understudied. We then filled in the knowledge gaps by developing and analyzing a stochastic, individual-based SIR model that includes both heterogeneity in transmission and susceptibility and flexibly allows for positive or negative correlations between transmissibility and susceptibility. We found that in comparison to the uncorrelated case, positive correlations result in major epidemics that are larger, faster, and more likely, whereas negative correlations result in major epidemics that are smaller and less likely. We additionally found that, counter to the conventional wisdom that heterogeneity in susceptibility always reduces outbreak size, heterogeneity in susceptibility can lead to major epidemics that are larger and more likely than the homogeneous case when correlations between transmissibility and susceptibility are positive, but this effect only arises at small to moderate R0. Moreover, positive correlations can frequently lead to major epidemics with subcritical R0. Ultimately, we show that correlations between transmissibility and susceptibility profoundly impact disease dynamics.
