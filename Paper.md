1. Introduction:
	- What is PhenHet
	- Why PhenHet is important
	- Literature of PhenHet
		- Old Papers,
		- Todd-Dwyer
		- Novozhilov
		- Their limitation/flaws
2. Random Network Approaches
	- Introduction to MSV type of random network framework
	- Zhao1 Result: no locality, heterogeneity of in-degree
		- Assumptions
		- Connection with Known Result
	- MFSH (need further investigation): no locality, heterogeneity of general degree(equal in and out degree)
		- Assumptions
	- MSV configuration model: Heterogeneity of general degree with locality
		- Assumptions
		- $\mathcal{R}^*_c$ Result
		- Discussion of $\mathcal{R}_c$ vs $\mathcal{R}^*_c$: competing infection
		- $\mathcal{R}_i$ Result
