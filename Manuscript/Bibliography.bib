    abstract = { The evolution of influenza viruses results in (i) recurrent annual epidemics of disease that are caused by progressive antigenic drift of influenza A and B viruses due to the mutability of the RNA genome and (ii) infrequent but severe pandemics caused by the emergence of novel influenza A subtypes to which the population has little immunity. The latter characteristic is a consequence of the wide antigenic diversity and peculiar host range of influenza A viruses and the ability of their segmented RNA genomes to undergo frequent genetic reassortment (recombination) during mixed infections. Contrasting features of the evolution of recently circulating influenza AH1N1, AH3N2 and B viruses include the rapid drift of AH3N2 viruses as a single lineage, the slow replacement of successive antigenic variants of AH1N1 viruses and the co–circulation over some 25 years of antigenically and genetically distinct lineages of influenza B viruses. Constant monitoring of changes in the circulating viruses is important for maintaining the efficacy of influenza vaccines in combating disease. }

abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae commonly colonizes the nasopharynx and has the potential to cause life-threatening infections. Many variants of this pathogen are recognized that have subtly different capsule (an external polysaccharide coat) structures, which prompt distinct immune responses from the host and allow classification of this pathogen into serotypes. A consistent pattern of multiple coexisting serotypes occurs in human populations. Cobey and Lipsitch (p. 1376, published online 1 March) probed the mechanisms behind serotype coexistence by developing an ecological model and feeding it data from nasopharyngeal carriage studies. The human immune response preserves antigenic variation in a bacterial pathogen. Over 90 capsular serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a common nasopharyngeal colonizer and major cause of pneumonia, bacteremia, and meningitis, are known. It is unclear why some serotypes can persist at all: They are more easily cleared from carriage and compete poorly in vivo. Serotype-specific immune responses, which could promote diversity in principle, are weak enough to allow repeated colonizations by the same type. We show that weak serotype-specific immunity and an acquired response not specific to the capsule can together reproduce observed diversity. Serotype-specific immunity stabilizes competition, and acquired immunity to noncapsular antigens reduces fitness differences. Our model can be used to explain the effects of pneumococcal vaccination and indicates general factors that regulate the diversity of pathogens.}}

    abstract = { Repeated measures data for rotavirus infection in children within 14 day care centres (DCCs) in the Oxfordshire area, UK, are used to explore aspects of rotavirus transmission and immunity. A biologically realistic model for the transmission of infection is presented as a set of probability models suitable for application to the data. Two transition events are modelled separately: incidence and recovery. The complexity of the underlying mechanistic model is reflected in the choice of the fixed variables in the probability models. Parameter estimation was carried out using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We use the parameter estimates obtained to build a profile of the natural history of rotavirus reinfection in an individual child. We infer that rotavirus transmission in children in DCCs is dependent on the DCC prevalence, with symptomatic infection of longer duration, but no more infectious per day of infectious period, than asymptomatic infection. There was evidence that a recent previous infection reduces the risk of disease and, to a lesser extent, reinfection, but not duration of infection. The results provide evidence that partial immunity to rotavirus infection develops over several time scales. }

abstract = {In The Netherlands, an epidemic outbreak of pertussis took place in 1996–1997. Understanding of the causes of the epidemic is hampered by the fact that many cases of infection with Bordetella pertussis go by unnoticed, and by the fact that immunity against infection does not last lifelong. Motivated by these observations, we develop and analyze an age-structured epidemic model that takes these factors into account. A distinction is made between infection in immunologically naive individuals, and infection in individuals whose immune system has been primed before by infection or vaccination. While the former often lead to severe symptoms and thus are more often diagnosed and notified, the latter are largely sub-clinical. The main questions are: (1) to what extent do sub-clinical infections contribute to the circulation of B. pertussis; and (2) what might be the causes for the recent epidemic? To answer these questions, we first present a new method to estimate the force of infection from notification data. The method is applied to the 1988–1995 case notification data from The Netherlands. Estimates of the force of infection vary greatly, depending on the rate at which immunity is lost, and on the fraction of sub-clinical infections. For the 1988–1995 period, our analysis indicates that if immunity is lost at a small rate and if a majority of infections is sub-clinical, the contribution of infection in adults to the transmission process cannot be neglected. Our results furthermore indicate that a decrease in the duration of protection after vaccination due to a change in the pathogen is the most likely factor to account for the 1996–1997 epidemic.}

abstract = {Pertussis is a highly infectious respiratory disease that is currently responsible for nearly 300,000 annual deaths worldwide, primarily in infants in developing countries. Despite sustained high vaccine uptake, a resurgence in pertussis incidence has been reported in a number of countries. This resurgence has led to critical questions regarding the transmission impacts of vaccination and pertussis immunology. We analyzed pertussis incidence in Thailand—both age-stratified and longitudinal aggregate reports—over the past 30 y. To dissect the contributions of waning pertussis immunity and repeat infections to pertussis epidemiology in Thailand following a pronounced increase in vaccine uptake, we used likelihood-based statistical inference methods to evaluate the support for multiple competing transmission models. We found that, in contrast to other settings, there is no evidence for pertussis resurgence in Thailand, with each model examined pointing to a substantial rise in herd immunity over the past 30 y. Using a variety of empirical metrics, we verified our findings by documenting signatures of changing herd immunity over the study period. Importantly, this work leads to the conclusion that repeat infections have played little role in shaping pertussis epidemiology in Thailand. Our results are surprisingly emphatic in support of measurable impact of herd immunity given the uncertainty associated with pertussis epidemiology.}}

    abstract = { Protective immunity after resolved hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been reported. However, the breadth of this immunity has remained controversial, and the role of neutralizing antibodies has not been well-defined. In the present study, two chimpanzees (CH96A008 and CH1494) with resolved monoclonal H77C (genotype 1a) infection were rechallenged with low-dose homologous H77C virus about 12 months after viral clearance; CH96A008 became persistently infected, and CH1494 had transient viremia lasting 2 weeks. CH1494 was subsequently either partially or completely protected following five homologous rechallenges with monoclonal H77C or polyclonal H77 and after six heterologous rechallenges with HC-J4 (genotype 1b) or HC-J6 (genotype 2a) viruses. Subsequently, a final challenge with H77C resulted in persistent HCV infection. In both chimpanzees, serum neutralizing antibodies against retroviral pseudoparticles bearing the H77C envelope proteins were not detected during the initial infection or during rechallenge. However, anamnestic cellular immune responses developed during the initial homologous rechallenge, in particular in CH96A008, which developed a persistent infection. Polyprotein sequences of viruses recovered from CH1494 after the two homologous rechallenges that resulted in transient viremia were identical with the H77C virus. In contrast, the polyprotein sequences of viruses recovered from both chimpanzees after homologous rechallenge resulting in persistent infection had numerous changes. These findings have important implications for our understanding of immunity against HCV; even in the best-case scenario with autologous rechallenge, low-level viral persistence was seen in the presence of primed T-cell responses. }

Markers of viral replication and host immunity were studied in five chimpanzees sequentially inoculated over a period of 3 years with different HCV strains of proven infectivity. Each rechallenge of a convalescent chimpanzee with the same or a different HCV strain resulted in the reappearance of viremia, which was due to infection with the subsequent challenge virus. The evidence indicates that HCV infection does not elicit protective immunity against reinfection with homologous or heterologous strains, which raises concerns for the development of effective vaccines against HCV.}}

    abstract = { Why are some diseases more virulent than others? Vector–borne diseases such as malaria and water–borne diseases such as cholera are generally more virulent than diseases spread by direct contagion. One factor that characterizes both vector– and water–borne diseases is their ability to spread over long distances, thus causing infection of susceptible individuals distant from the infected individual. Here we show that this ability of the pathogen to infect distant individuals in a spatially structured host population leads to the evolution of a more virulent pathogen. We use a lattice model in which reproduction is local but infection can vary between completely local to completely global. With completely global infection the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is the same as in mean–field models while a lower virulence is predicted as infection becomes more local. There is characteristically a period of relatively moderate increase in virulence followed by a more rapid rise with increasing proportions of global infection as we move beyond a ‘critical connectivity’. In the light of recent work emphasizing the existence of ‘small world’ networks in human populations, our results suggests that if the world is getting ‘smaller’ (as populations become more connected) diseases may evolve higher virulence. }

In our microevolutionary selection experiments, the infectivity of the virus was, as predicted by the theory, reduced in the most viscous populations. We therefore provide empirical support for the theory that population structure affects the evolution of infectious organisms.}}

abstract = {Traditional explorations of infectious disease evolution have considered the competition between two cross-reactive strains within the standard framework of disease models. Such techniques predict that diseases should evolve to be highly transmissible, benign to the host and possess a long infectious period: in general, diseases do not conform to this ideal. Here we consider a more holistic approach, suggesting that evolution is a trade-off between adaptive pressures at different scales: within host, between hosts and at the population level. We present a model combining within-host pathogen dynamics and transmission between individuals governed by an explicit contact network, where transmission dynamics between hosts are a function of the interaction between the pathogen and the hosts’ immune system, though ultimately constrained by the contacts each infected host possesses. Our results show how each of the scales places constraints on the evolutionary behavior, and that complex dynamics may emerge due to the feedbacks between epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics. In particular, multiple stable states can occur with switching between them stochastically driven.}

Theoretical investigations show that the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Numerical examples of three typical network structures also verify the theoretical results. Furthermore, comparison between network node degree and its infected percents implies that there is a strong positive correlation between both; namely, the node with bigger degree is infected with more percents. Finally, we discuss the impact of the epidemic spreading rate of media as well as the effective recovered rate on the network average infected state. Theoretical and numerical results show that (1) network average infected percents go up (down) with the increase of the infected rate of media (the effective recovered rate); (2) the infected rate of media has almost no influence on network average infected percents for the fully connected network and NW small-world network; (3) network average infected percents decrease exponentially with the increase of the effective recovered rate, implying that the percents can be controlled at low level by an appropriate large effective recovered rate.}

 abstract = { For epidemiologists, evolutionary biologists, and health-care professionals, real-time and predictive modeling of infectious disease is of growing importance. This book provides a timely and comprehensive introduction to the modeling of infectious diseases in humans and animals, focusing on recent developments as well as more traditional approaches.  Matt Keeling and Pejman Rohani move from modeling with simple differential equations to more recent, complex models, where spatial structure, seasonal "forcing," or stochasticity influence the dynamics, and where computer simulation needs to be used to generate theory. In each of the eight chapters, they deal with a specific modeling approach or set of techniques designed to capture a particular biological factor. They illustrate the methodology used with examples from recent research literature on human and infectious disease modeling, showing how such techniques can be used in practice. Diseases considered include BSE, foot-and-mouth, HIV, measles, rubella, smallpox, and West Nile virus, among others. Particular attention is given throughout the book to the development of practical models, useful both as predictive tools and as a means to understand fundamental epidemiological processes. To emphasize this approach, the last chapter is dedicated to modeling and understanding the control of diseases through vaccination, quarantine, or culling.    Comprehensive, practical introduction to infectious disease modeling  Builds from simple to complex predictive models  Models and methodology fully supported by examples drawn from research literature  Practical models aid students' understanding of fundamental epidemiological processes  For many of the models presented, the authors provide accompanying programs written in Java, C, Fortran, and MATLAB  In-depth treatment of role of modeling in understanding disease control   },

The rise of the Internet and the wide availability of inexpensive computers have made it possible to gather and analyze network data on a large scale, and the development of a variety of new theoretical tools has allowed us to extract new knowledge from many different kinds of networks. The study of networks is broadly interdisciplinary and important developments have occurred in many fields, including mathematics, physics, computer and information sciences, biology, and the social sciences. This book brings together the most important breakthroughs in each of these fields and presents them in a coherent fashion, highlighting the strong interconnections between work in different areas. Subjects covered include the measurement and structure of networks in many branches of science, methods for analyzing network data, including methods developed in physics, statistics, and sociology, the fundamentals of graph theory, computer algorithms, and spectral methods, mathematical models of networks, including random graph models and generative models, and theories of dynamical processes taking place on networks.}",

@article{AllenEtAl:2021,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A resurgence in bacterial STIs, notably syphilis, among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) has been detected in England. A Canadian modelling study postulated that antiretroviral therapy (ART) may increase susceptibility to syphilis. We assess the association between ART and syphilis incidence in a comprehensive national cohort of MSM living with HIV in England. METHODS: National surveillance data were used to create a cohort of MSM attending for both HIV and STI care in England between 2009 and 2016. Survival analysis was used to calculate the incidence of infectious syphilis during periods on and off ART. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to assess the association between ART use and syphilis, after adjustment for potential confounders, including, as a proxy measure for high-risk behaviour, being diagnosed with >1 other STI prior to a syphilis diagnosis. RESULTS: 19 428 HIV diagnosed MSM contributed 112 960 person-years of follow-up from 2009 to 2016. The overall rate of syphilis was 78.0 cases per 1000 person-years follow-up. Syphilis rates were higher among men receiving ART (36.8) compared with those who did not (28.4) (absolute rate difference 4.7 cases per 1000 person-years). Multivariable analysis showed no statistical association between receiving ART and syphilis. Increased risk of syphilis was found in MSM aged 25-34 (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.51) and in those diagnosed with two other STIs (HR 5.83, 95% CI 5.37 to 6.32). CONCLUSION: While we observed a small increase in the rate of syphilis among those on ART, when adjusting for potential confounding factors, including a proxy measure for high-risk behaviour, there was no evidence of an increased risk of syphilis in MSM receiving ART. High-risk sexual behaviour markers were the main risk factors for syphilis, and our results highlight the need for STI prevention interventions in MSM living with HIV to target these particularly high-risk sexual networks.},

@article{ArandoEtAl:2019,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since 2000, substantial increases in syphilis in men who have sex with men (MSM) have been reported in many cities. Condomless anal sex (CAS) is one of the factors, along with drugs for sex and sex in group. This study identified factors and clinical manifestations as well as Treponema pallidum (T.pallidum) strains that could be related to early syphilis in Barcelona. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted in a sexually transmitted infections unit in 2015. Epidemiological, behavioral, clinical and microbiological variables were collected in a structured form. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed focusing on HIV-positive patients. RESULTS: Overall, 274 cases were classified as having early syphilis (27.5% primary, 51.3% secondary, and 21.2% early latent syphilis). In all, 94% of participants were MSM and 36.3% were HIV-positive. The median number of sexual contacts in the last 12 months was 10; 72.5% practiced CAS, 50.6% had sex in group, and 54.7% consumed drugs. HIV-positive cases had more anonymous sex contacts (p = 0.041), CAS (p = 0.002), sex in group (p < 0.001) and drugs for sex (p < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, previous syphilis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.81 [2.88-8.15]), previous Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection (aOR 3.8 [2.28-6.43]), and serosorting (aOR 20.4 [7.99-60.96]) were associated with having syphilis. Clinically, multiple chancres were present in 31% of cases with no differences on serostatus, but anal chancre was most common in HIV-positive patients (p = 0.049). Molecular typing did not conclusively explain clinical presentation in relation to specific T.pallidum strains. CONCLUSION: Control of syphilis remains a challenge. Similar to prior studies, HIV-positive patients were found to engage more often in sexual behaviors associated with syphilis than HIV-negative patients. Clinical manifestations were rather similar in both groups, although anal chancre was most common in HIV-positive patients. Various strain types of syphilis were found, but no clinical associations were identified.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to examine the incidence of syphilis in men who have sex with men (MSM) and identify subgroups of MSM at a higher risk of syphilis infection. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of MSM attending a sexual health clinic in Australia, during 2013-2019, who had at least 2 syphilis serological tests during the study period. The incidence of syphilis was expressed as per 100 person-years. A cox regression analysis was conducted to identify risk factors for syphilis. RESULTS: A total of 24 391 individual MSM (75 086 consultations) were included. A total of 1404 new syphilis cases were diagnosed with an incidence of 3.7/100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 3.5-3.9). Syphilis incidence was higher in MSM with human immunodeficiency virus ([HIV] 9.3/100 person-years) than in MSM taking HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) (6.9/100 person-years) or HIV-negative MSM not taking PrEP (2.2/100 person-years). Risk factors associated with high incidence of syphilis included the following: MSM with HIV (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.7), MSM taking HIV PrEP (aHR 2.1), past history of syphilis infection (aHR 2.4), injecting drug use (aHR 2.7), condomless anal sex (aHR 1.7), >4 sexual partners in the last 12 months (aHR 1.2), and concurrent sexually transmitted infection (chlamydia and gonorrhoea) (aHR 1.6). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of syphilis remains high among MSM, particularly in subgroups with associated risk factors for syphilis infections. These data highlight the need for biomedical and behavioral interventions to be targeted to subgroups of MSM at the highest risk of syphilis infection.},

	abstract = {Opioid use and the rising case reports of STDs represent co-occurring epidemics; research indicates that persons who inject drugs (PWID) may be at increased risk for acquiring STDs. We use the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG, 2011-2015) to examine the prevalence of risky sexual behaviors and STD diagnoses among PWID. We describe demographic characteristics, sexual behaviors, and self-reported STD diagnoses of sexually active women and men, separately, by whether they had ever engaged in injection-related behaviors (age 15-44; N = 9006 women, N = 7210 men). Results indicate that in 2011-15, 1.4% of women and 2.6% of men reported ever engaging in injection-related behaviors. Examining the full logistic regression models indicate that for women, sex with a PWID in the past 12 months (AOR = 5.8, 95% CI: 2.9, 11.7), exchanging money/drugs for sex in the past 12 months (AOR = 3.6, 95% CI: 1.2, 10.9), chlamydia and/or gonorrhea diagnosis in the past 12 months (AOR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.2, 5.3), ever having a syphilis diagnosis (AOR = 8.5, 95% CI: 3.1, 23.4), and ever having a herpes diagnosis (AOR = 3.3, 95% CI: 1.0, 10.3) were associated with increased odds of engaging in injection-related behaviors. For men, sex with a PWID in the past 12 months (AOR = 10.9, 95% CI: 4.3, 27.7), ever being diagnosed with syphilis (AOR = 5.8, 95% CI: 1.8, 18.0), and ever being diagnosed with herpes (AOR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.0, 7.1) were significantly associated with increased odds of engaging in injection-related behaviors.

@article{CaccamoKachurWilliams:2017,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Homelessness affects an estimated 1.6 million US youth annually. Compared with housed youth, homeless youth are more likely to engage in high-risk behaviors, including inconsistent condom use, multiple sex partners, survival sex, and alcohol/drug use, putting them at increased sexually transmitted disease (STD) risk. However, there is no national estimate of STD prevalence among this population. METHODS: We identified 10 peer-reviewed articles (9 unique studies) reporting STD prevalence among homeless US youth (2000-2015). Descriptive and qualitative analyses identified STD prevalence ranges and risk factors among youth. RESULTS: Eight studies reported specific STD prevalence estimates, mainly chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Overall STD prevalence among homeless youth ranged from 6% to 32%. STD rates for girls varied from 16.7% to 46%, and from 9% to 13.1% in boys. Most studies were conducted in the Western United States, with no studies from the Southeast or Northeast. Youths who experienced longer periods of homelessness were more likely to engage in high-risk sexual behaviors. Girls had lower rates of condom use and higher rates of STDs; boys were more likely to engage in anal and anonymous sex. Additionally, peer social networks contributed to protective effects on individual sexual risk behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Sexually transmitted disease prevalence estimates among homeless youth fluctuated greatly by study. Sexually transmitted disease risk behaviors are associated with unmet survival needs, length of homelessness, and influence of social networks. To promote sexual health and reduce STD rates, we need better estimates of STD prevalence, more geographic diversity of studies, and interventions addressing the behavioral associations identified in our review.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate prevalence and risk factors of syphilis infection among female sex workers (FSWs) in Shenzhen, China. METHODS: Observational study among (2009-2012) 1653 FSWs recruited by venue-based sampling using questionnaire-based interviews for socio-demographics, behaviours and syphilis testing results. Logistic regression was used to assess risk factors of syphilis infection. RESULTS: The overall syphilis prevalence was 4.7%, showing a slightly decreasing trend. Factors significantly associated with syphilis infection were inconsistent condom use (OR = 1.87, P = 0.015), illicit drug use (OR = 5.45, P < 0.001) and older age in years (OR = 1.08, P < 0.001). Venues where FSWs were recruited and duration of commercial sex work were not significantly associated with syphilis infection (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Syphilis is still common among FSWs in Shenzhen, China. Current comprehensive prevention programmes (e.g. condom promotion and peer education) should be continued to maintain and increase safe sexual practices and to reduce illicit drug use among FSWs. Expanding point-of-care syphilis screening programmes may be an important strategy for early diagnosis. We recommend timely and effective treatment programmes to be linked to such screening programmes.},

	abstract = {The incidence of congenital syphilis in Florida increased sixfold from 1985 through 1989, and more than 80% of the cases occurred in metropolitan areas of southern Florida. To characterize the population of pregnant women in Florida at high risk of delivering an infant with congenital syphilis, the authors conducted a case-control study using birth certificates. Birth certificates were obtained for 256 of the 344 live infants reported as having congenital syphilis from 1987 through 1989 (74%); the 246 of these infants born in hospitals were matched for hospital and week of birth with an equal number of controls. In conditional multiple logistic regression, the following maternal characteristics were independent risk factors for congenital syphilis: young age, black race, single marital status, absence of a father's name on the birth certificate, previous pregnancy, substance abuse, and lack of prenatal care. Although the national origin of the mother was not a significant risk factor, the infants of black mothers born in the United States were at greater risk than the infants of black mothers born outside the United States. Mothers who had < or = 3 prenatal visits had an increased risk of delivering an infant with congenital syphilis as compared with mothers who had > 3 visits. This study suggests that targeted outreach efforts are necessary to control congenital syphilis and provides guidance for public health intervention activities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rates of early syphilis in US women are steadily increasing, but predictors of infection in this group are not clearly defined. METHODS: This retrospective analysis focused on women enrolled in the US CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems cohort between January 2005 and December 2016 with syphilis testing performed. The primary outcome of incident syphilis infection was defined serologically as a newly positive test with positive confirmatory testing after a negative test or a 2-dilution increase in rapid plasma regain titer. Infection rates were calculated for each woman-year in care with testing. Predictors of syphilis were sought among sociodemographics, clinical information, and self-reported behaviors. Multivariable logistic regression models were created; a subgroup analysis assessed predictors in women of reproductive age. RESULTS: The annual rate of incident syphilis among 4416 women engaged in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care and tested during the 12-year study period was 760/100 000 person-years. Independent predictors of infection were injection drug use as a risk factor for HIV acquisition (aOR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-3.9), hepatitis C infection (aOR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4), black race (aOR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-3.7 compared with white race), and more recent entry to care (since 2005 compared with 1994-2004). Predictors were similar in women aged 18-49. CONCLUSIONS: Syphilis infection is common among US women in HIV care. Syphilis screening and prevention efforts should focus on women reporting drug use and with hepatitis C coinfection. Future studies should identify specific behaviors that mediate syphilis acquisition risk in women who use drugs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Syphilis among men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV is of public health concern, thus the objective of the study is to determine the correlates of prevalent syphilis infection in this population so that urgent interventions could be instituted. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted during the period September 2020-June 2021 among MSM who attended a large HIV Clinic in Trinidad. A questionnaire was administered to obtain socio-demographic data and correlates of prevalent syphilis and patients were screened for syphilis using the traditional algorithm. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were conducted and multivariable logistic regression factors was used to assess factors significantly associated with a syphilis diagnosis. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty four MSM were enrolled; age range 18-64 years, median age 33 years and 89 (34.4%) were actively bisexual. The prevalence of syphilis was 28% (74/264) and 89.2% (66/74) of these infections were asymptomatic. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that those patients who participated in sex with anonymous partners (OR 2.09; 95% CI, 1.03-4.26), those with a previous diagnosis of syphilis (OR 5.16; 95% CI, 1.03-25.83) and those who used marijuana in the last 12 months (OR 2.13; 95% CI, 1.14-3.96) were more likely to be diagnosed with syphilis. CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of asymptomatic syphilis among MSM living with HIV in Trinidad. Repeat episodes of syphilis and anonymous sex may play a role in the transmission dynamics of T pallidum infection in this population, thus urgent public health prevention interventions are warranted.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Syphilis is one of the leading causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality and is one of the most important public health problems. There was no study showing syphilis serostatus and its related factors among pregnant women in the current study area. This study was aimed to assess the magnitude of syphilis serostatus and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care in Jinka town public health facilities. METHOD: Institution based cross-sectional study design was conducted in Jinka town public health facilities, southern Ethiopia from the 1st July to the 1st September, 2020. A systematic sampling technique was used to select 629 study subjects. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire through face-to-face interviews and records were reviewed to check syphilis test results. Data were coded and entered by using Epi-data version 4.432 and analyzed using SPSS version 25. The binary logistic regression model was used to investigate factors associated with syphilis. A p-value of < 0.05 at multivariable analysis was considered statistically significant. RESULT: In this study, syphilis sero-prevalence among pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics was 4.8% (95% CI: 3.12, 6.48). Rural residence [AOR: 2.873; 95%CI (1.171, 7.050)], alcohol use [AOR: 3.340; 95% CI (1.354, 8.241)] and having multiple sexual partner [AOR: 5.012; 95% CI (1.929, 13.020)] were statistically significantly associated with syphilis. CONCLUSION: Sero-prevalence of syphilis was high. Being a rural residence, having multiple sexual partners, alcohol use were factors associated with syphilis. Therefore, substantial efforts have to be made to provide regular health education for pregnant women at the antenatal clinic on the avoidance of risky behaviors and the risk of syphilis on their pregnancy.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of syphilis and its associated factors in women who were treated at public maternity hospitals and received prenatal care in a primary healthcare unit. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 399 postpartum women. Interviews were conducted, and additional data were extracted from the pregnant woman's booklet, medical records, and printed tests. The dependent variable was a gestational syphilis diagnosis. The independent variables were grouped into socioeconomic and demographic, behavioral, reproductive, and prenatal blocks. The prevalence, prevalence ratios, and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. The chi 2 test was also performed (p</=0.05). Multivariate analysis was performed using Poisson regression models. RESULTS: The prevalence of gestational syphilis was 9.61% (95%CI: 7.14-12.83). We identified the following determining factors (adjusted prevalence ratios): history of sexually transmitted infections (2.3), first sexual intercourse by the age of 15 (2.42), partner having a history of syphilis (5.98), partner using crack/cocaine (6.42) and marijuana and others (3.02), not having a partner (3.07), low income (2.85), history of stillbirth (5.21), beginning prenatal care in the third trimester (3.15), and prenatal care received in a primary healthcare unit (without a Family Health Strategy team) (0.35). CONCLUSION: Individual and prenatal factors were associated with gestational syphilis. To control congenital syphilis, targeted interventions are needed to control syphilis in the adult population including expansion of access to quality prenatal care with identification of risks for syphilis and connection between prevention and treatment actions, implementation of strategies focused on early sexual education, effective establish prenatal care involving both partners, and effective implementation of the National Men's Health Policy (PNAISH - Politica Nacional de Atencao Integral a Saude dos Homens ).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of syphilis infection in pregnancy is increasing at an alarming rate. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate sociodemographic risk factors and adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with syphilis infection during pregnancy in a current US population of live births. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective analysis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Natality Live Birth database for the years 2016 to 2019. All live births were eligible for inclusion. Deliveries with missing data on syphilis infection were excluded. We analyzed the database comparing pregnancies complicated by maternal infection with syphilis with those without infection. Several maternal sociodemographic factors and adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association of these factors with syphilis infection in pregnancy, and adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes while adjusting for potential confounders. Data were presented as adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Of the 15,341,868 births included, 17,408 (0.11%) were complicated by maternal infection with syphilis. Concurrent infection with gonorrhea was associated with the highest risk of syphilis in pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio, 7.24; 95% confidence interval, 6.79-7.72). Low educational attainment (less than high school: adjusted odds ratio, 4.40; 95% confidence interval, 3.93-4.92), non-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio, 3.81; 95% confidence interval, 3.65-3.98), and Medicaid insurance (adjusted odds ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 2.03-2.23) were also associated with a significantly increased risk of infection. Syphilis infection was associated with an increased risk for preterm birth (<37 weeks: adjusted odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.31; <32 weeks: adjusted odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-13.7), low birthweight (adjusted odds ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-1.40), congenital malformations (adjusted odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-1.78), low 5-minute Apgar scores (adjusted odds ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.41), neonatal intensive care unit admission (adjusted odds ratio, 2.19; 95% confidence interval, 2.11-2.28), immediate ventilation (adjusted odds ratio, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.39-1.57), and prolonged ventilation (adjusted odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.44-1.73). CONCLUSION: We identified several risk factors and adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with syphilis infection in pregnancy. Given the concerning rise in prevalence of pregnancy infections, public health strategies aimed at infection prevention and access to timely screening and treatment to reduce associated adverse pregnancy outcomes are urgently needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Female Sex Workers (FSWs) are main drivers of the HIV epidemic in Nepal. The work environment of sex work in Nepal is differentiated into establishment based (e.g. massage parlors, dance restaurants, hotels and lodges) and street based (e.g. streets, parks and markets). The study compares HIV, syphilis and risk behaviours among establishment-based FSWs and street-based FSWs in Kathmandu Valley of Nepal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional bio-behavioral surveys in 2006, 2008, 2011 and 2015 aimed to sample 2093 FSWs using two stage cluster sampling in the Kathmandu valley. Statistical analysis used chi-squared tests and logistic regression models to assess differences of HIV, syphilis and risk behaviors among street-based FSWs and establishment-based FSWs. RESULTS: The study included 39.7% street-based FSWs and 60.3% establishment-based FSWs. The street-based FSWs had lower education levels, older age groups, separated, longer duration of sex work and inconsistent condom used with clients than establishment-based FSWs (p<0.05). Establishment-based FSWs were lower exposure to HIV intervention programs and pervasive alcohol consumption and use of drugs (p<0.05). The multivariate analysis showed that street-based FSWs were more likely of HIV test (aOR=1.25, 95%CI=1.04, 1.49), HIV (aOR=4.72, 95%CI=2.19, 10.15) and syphilis (aOR=7.96, 95%CI=3.49, 18.15) than establishment-based FSWs. CONCLUSION: Street-based FSWs possessed higher risk behaviour and have higher HIV and syphilis prevalence. HIV prevention interventions targeting FSWs should consider risks and vulnerability of street-based FSWs. .},

	abstract = {SETTING: Two free-standing urban human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing and counselling (HCT) centres in Bhutan offering services to the general population and targeting the most at-risk populations (MARPs). OBJECTIVES: To assess the trend in testing for HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis in both the general population and MARPs, and to determine if sociodemographic and risk behaviour characteristics are associated with HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis seropositivity. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using client records, 2009 - 2012. RESULTS: Of 7894 clients, 3009 (38%) were from the general population, while 4885 (62%) were from MARPs. Over the 4-year period, testing declined progressively among the general population, while it increased or remained static for MARPs. Of 4885 MARPs, seropositivity was respectively 0.7%, 1.3% and 1.2% for HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis. Female sex workers (FSWs) (relative risk [RR] 4.4, P = 0.03) and partners of person living with HIV (RR 25.9, P < 0.001) had a higher risk of being HIV-positive. FSWs had also a greater risk of being syphilis-positive (RR 9.1, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The increase in uptake of HCT services by MARPs is a welcome finding; however, the relatively static trends call for the introduction of community outreach approaches. The critical gateway being provided to MARPs is an 'opportunity' for the expansion of the current service package.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although systematic reviews of epidemiologic studies have been conducted for condom use and the risk of several sexually transmitted diseases, there have been no such reviews for condom use and syphilis. METHODS: A systematic literature review of epidemiologic studies published from 1972 to 2008 was conducted to evaluate study methods and measures of association reported for condom use and risk of syphilis. RESULTS: All 12 included studies had significant methodologic limitations. Nine (75%) studies were cross-sectional. Although 11 (92%) studies assessed consistent condom use, no studies assessed correct use or condom use problems, nor did any document exposure to a partner infected with syphilis. Ten studies had insufficient information to distinguish prevalent from incident infections. Two studies that assessed both incident infection and consistent condom use suggested a reduced risk of syphilis with consistent condom use; 1 study was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Significant methodologic limitations exist for all reviewed studies of syphilis and condom use. Among the 2 most rigorously designed studies, both suggested a reduced risk of syphilis with consistent condom use. Additional studies incorporating rigorous methods are needed to further assess the effect of condom use on risk of syphilis.},

	abstract = {Among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals, syphilis is an important sexually transmitted infection (STI), and repeat infections are common. Identifying risk factors for delineating the trends in repeat syphilis are essential for STI and HIV prevention.This study is to investigate the dynamic of the syphilis epidemic among HIV-infected patients and to identify the risk factors associated with repeat syphilis.A population-based cohort design was used to analyze claim data between January 2000 and December 2010 using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The Poisson regression test was used to identify risk factors for repeat syphilis.Of 13,239 HIV-infected patients, annual syphilis screen tests have been performed in 4,907 (37.1%) of these patients. Syphilis has been diagnosed in 956 (19.5%) patients, and 524 (10.7%) had repeat syphilis. The annual trend in repeat syphilis showed a significant increase in the study period (beta = 0.23, P < .001). Younger age (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 1.43; 95% CI 1.11-1.86), male gender (aIRR 11.14, 95% CI 4.16-29.79), a history of STIs (aIRR 1.39, 95% CI 1.21-1.59) were independently associated with repeat syphilis. The retention in HIV care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy >/=85% ([aIRR] 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.98; P < .001) were associated with a reduced risk of repeat syphilis.The incidence of repeat syphilis increased during 11 years of follow-up. The screening of syphilis for early diagnosis and retention in HIV care with medication adherence should be encouraged to minimize the risk of repeat syphilis in the targeted population.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To implement an HIV prevention intervention among female commercial sex workers (CSW), and to monitor key outcomes using routinely collected clinical and laboratory data. DESIGN: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of data from an open-enrollment cohort. SETTING: One public sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic and about 25 brothels in La Paz, Bolivia. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 508 female CSW who work at brothels and attend a public STD clinic. INTERVENTION: Improved STD clinical care, supported by periodic laboratory testing, and behavioral interventions performed by a local non-governmental organization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of gonorrhea, syphilis (reactive plasma reagin titer > or = 1 : 16), genital ulcer disease, chlamydial infection, and trichomoniasis; self-reported condom use in the previous month; and HIV seroprevalence. RESULTS: From 1992 through 1995, prevalence of gonorrhea among CSW declined from 25.8 to 9.9% (P < 0.001), syphilis from 14.9 to 8.7% (P = 0.02), and genital ulcer disease from 5.7 to 1.3% (P = 0.006); trends in prevalence of chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis were not significant. Self-reported condom use during vaginal sex in the past month increased from 36.3 to 72.5% (P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, condom use was inversely associated with gonorrhea [odds ratio (OR), 0.63; 95% confidence interval (Cl), 0.41-0.97], syphilis (OR, 0.39; 95% Cl, 0.23-0.64), and trichomoniasis (OR, 0.44; 95% Cl, 0.32-0.71). In 1995, HIV seroprevalence among CSW was 0.1%. CONCLUSION: Effective prevention interventions for female CSW can be implemented through public services and non-governmental organizations while HIV rates are still low, and key outcomes can be monitored using data obtained from periodic screening examinations.},

@article{LiEtAl:2012,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Female sex workers (FSWs) have become one of the key populations for HIV/STI control in China. Categorization of FSWs can help prioritize HIV/STI intervention efforts. We examined 2 possible categorizations of FSWs and the relationship with syphilis infection risk in Liuzhou City, China. METHODS: From October 2009 to February 2010, a total of 583 FSWs recruited by respondent-driven sampling in a cross-sectional survey were tested for syphilis and interviewed to collect sociodemographic and behavioral information. Respondents were categorized based on transaction price for vaginal sex and type of sex work location. The relationship between the 2 categorizations and syphilis infection risk was assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of lifetime and active syphilis infection were 8.6% and 4.1%, respectively. Lifetime and active syphilis prevalence was higher among FSWs in the lowest price category (52.7% and 25.4%, respectively) and those working in streets (69.7% and 39.8%, respectively) or through telephone (46.3% and 17.0%, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that lifetime syphilis prevalence was significantly higher among street- (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 38.7, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 10.7-139.9) and telephone-based FSWs (AOR: 10.8, 95% CI: 3.3-35.1), and that active syphilis prevalence was significantly higher among street-based FSWs (AOR: 15.2, 95% CI: 3.7-62.1) after adjusting for demographic and behavioral factors. CONCLUSIONS: Categorization based on sex work location was more closely related to the risk of syphilis infection than the price classification. Street- and telephone-based FSWs had significantly higher risk of syphilis infection. Focused interventions among these particular high-risk FSWs subgroups are warranted.},

	abstract = {Alcohol use has been associated with multiple types of sexual risk behaviors, such as condomless sex or having multiple sexual partners, behaviors that are linked to the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The aim of this review was to present updated evidence to demonstrate an association between alcohol consumption and STIs and evaluate the causal nature of this link, as well as to present interventions that reduce alcohol consumption and its effect on STIs. We conducted a systematic review according to the PRISMA guidelines using PubMed and Embase databases. Cohort studies and case-control studies were included. Any level of alcohol use served as the exposure variable, with the outcome restricted to non-HIV STIs, as reviews on alcohol use and HIV already exist. In total, 11 publications satisfied the inclusion criteria. The evidence suggests that there is an association between alcohol use, especially heavy drinking occasions, and STIs, with eight articles finding a statistically significant association. In addition to these results, there is indirect causal evidence from policy studies, and from the field of decision-making and sexual behavior with experimental evidence, that alcohol use increases the likelihood of risk-taking sexual behavior. It is important to have a deeper understanding of the association to develop effective prevention programs at community and individual levels. Preventive interventions should be implemented targeting the general population, in addition to specific campaigns directed at vulnerable subpopulations in order to reduce the risks.},

@article{MacedoEtAl:2017,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the sociodemographic, behavioral, and health care factors related to the occurrence of syphilis in women treated at public maternity hospitals. METHODS: This is a case-control study (239 cases and 322 controls) with women admitted to seven maternity hospitals in the municipality of Recife, Brazil, from July 2013 to July 2014. Eligible women were recruited after the result of the VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) under any titration. The selection of cases and controls was based on the result of the serology for syphilis using ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). The independent variables were grouped into: sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical and obstetric history, and health care in prenatal care and maternity hospital. Information was obtained by interview, during hospitalization, with the application of a questionnaire. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using logistic regression to identify the predicting factors of the variable to be explained. RESULTS: The logistic regression analysis identified as determinant factors for gestational syphilis: education level of incomplete basic education or illiterate (OR = 2.02), lack of access to telephone (OR = 2.4), catholic religion (OR = 1.70 ), four or more pregnancies (OR = 2.2), three or more sexual partners in the last year (OR = 3.1), use of illicit drugs before the age of 18 (OR = 3.0), and use of illicit drugs by the current partner (OR = 1.7). Only one to three prenatal appointments (OR = 3.5) and a previous history of sexually transmitted infection (OR = 9.7) were also identified as determinant factors. CONCLUSIONS: Sociodemographic, behavioral, and health care factors are associated with the occurrence of syphilis in women and should be taken into account in the elaboration of universal strategies aimed at the prevention and control of syphilis, but with a focus on situations of greater vulnerability. OBJETIVO: Determinar os fatores sociodemograficos, comportamentais e de assistencia a saude relacionados a ocorrencia de sifilis em mulheres atendidas em maternidades publicas. METODOS: Trata-se de um estudo caso-controle (239 casos e 322 controles) com mulheres admitidas em sete maternidades do municipio do Recife, no periodo de julho de 2013 a julho de 2014. As mulheres elegiveis foram recrutadas apos o resultado do VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) sob qualquer titulacao. A selecao dos casos e controles considerou o resultado da sorologia por ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), variavel dependente utilizada como diagnostico para sifilis neste estudo. As variaveis independentes foram agrupadas em: sociodemograficas; comportamentais; e antecedentes clinicos e obstetricos; e assistencia a saude no pre-natal e na maternidade. As informacoes foram obtidas por meio de entrevista, durante o internamento, por aplicacao de um questionario. Foi calculado odds ratio (OR), intervalo de confianca de 95% e realizada analise de regressao logistica para identificar os fatores preditores da variavel a ser explicada. RESULTADOS: A analise de regressao logistica identificou como fatores determinantes para a sifilis gestacional: nivel de escolaridade fundamental incompleto ou analfabeta (OR = 2,02), ausencia de acesso a telefone (OR = 2,4), religiao catolica (OR = 1,70), quatro ou mais gestacoes (OR = 2,2), tres ou mais parceiros sexuais no ultimo ano (OR = 3,1), uso de drogas ilicitas antes dos 18 anos (OR = 3,0) e uso de drogas ilicitas por parte do atual companheiro (OR = 1,7). Alem desses, foram observadas a ocorrencia de apenas uma a tres consultas ao pre-natal (OR = 3,5) e historia anterior de infeccao sexualmente transmissivel (OR = 9,7). CONCLUSOES: Fatores sociodemograficos, comportamentais e de assistencia a saude estao associados a ocorrencia de sifilis em mulheres e devem ser levados em consideracao na elaboracao de estrategias universais direcionadas a prevencao e controle da sifilis, porem com foco em situacoes de maior vulnerabilidade.},

	abstract = {Female sex workers (FSWs) are an important group of people vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections. Northern Brazil is a rural and socioeconomically underdeveloped region, with lack of epidemiological information on syphilis in key populations. This study investigated the prevalence and factors associated with exposure to Treponema pallidum among FSWs in three major cities in northern Brazil. This cross-sectional study was conducted with a convenience sample of 415 FSWs from the cities of Belem, Macapa, and Rio Branco. Blood samples and personal data were collected from January 2009 to August 2010. Rapid plasma reagin and immunoenzymatic assays were used to detect antibodies against T. pallidum. Logistic regression models were used to determine factors associated with exposure to T. pallidum. In total, 36.1% were exposed to T. pallidum, and 15.7% had active syphilis. Sexual risk behaviors, use of illicit drugs, low education, and reduced monthly income were associated with exposure to T. pallidum. The high rate of exposure to T. pallidum indicates the urgent need for measures to identify, treat, and prevent syphilis and an education program for the valuation, care, and social inclusion of FSWs in northern Brazil.},

@article{Mendez-LopezEtAl:2022,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Syphilis case notifications among men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) have increased markedly over the past two decades in Europe. We tested several potential factors for this resurgence. METHODS: Self-reported data from two cross-sectional waves of the European MSM Internet Survey (EMIS-2010 and EMIS-2017, N = 278,256 participants living in 31 European countries) were used to fit multivariable hierarchical logistic regression models designed to evaluate potential social, behavioural, and interventional determinants of syphilis diagnosis. Additional multivariable hierarchical negative binomial models investigated determinants of the number of non-steady male condomless anal intercourse (CAI) partners. We tested the hypothesis that more CAI and syphilis-screening are associated with syphilis resurgence, both linked to use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). FINDINGS: Between 2010 and 2017, incidence of syphilis diagnosis in the previous 12 months rose from 2.33% (95%CI: 2.26-2.40) of respondents reporting a syphilis diagnosis in 2010 compared with 4.54% (95%CI: 4.42-4.66) in 2017. Major factors contributing to syphilis diagnosis were living with diagnosed HIV (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.67, 95%CI: 2.32-3.07), each additional non-steady male CAI partner (aOR 1.01, 95%CI: 1.01-1.01), recency of STI-screening (previous month vs no screening, aOR 25.76, 95%CI: 18.23-36.41), selling sex (aOR 1.45, 95%CI: 1.27-1.65), and PrEP use (aOR 3.02, 95%CI: 2.30-3.96). Living with diagnosed HIV (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 3.91, 95%CI: 3.77-4.05), selling sex (aIRR 4.39, 95%CI: 4.19-4.59), and PrEP use (aIRR 5.82, 95%CI: 5.29-6.41) were associated with a higher number of non-steady male CAI partners. The association between PrEP use and increased chance of syphilis diagnosis was mediated by STI-screening recency and number of non-steady male CAI partners, both substantially higher in 2017 compared to 2010. INTERPRETATION: Syphilis cases are concentrated in three MSM population groups: HIV-diagnosed, PrEP users, and sex workers. Behavioural and interventional changes, particularly more non-steady male CAI partners and recency of STI-screening, are major contributing factors for increasing syphilis diagnoses among MSM in Europe.

METHODS: Case infants with presumptive and confirmed congenital syphilis were compared with control infants born to women with reactive serologies during pregnancy, allowing investigation of risk factors for congenital rather than acquired transmission of syphilis. Data were collected from congenital syphilis report forms and birth certificates for 186 case infants and 487 controls born from 1991 to 1993. Odds ratios were calculated for maternal risk factors. RESULTS: Significant statistical trends were found for timing of first prenatal visit and number of visits. Other significant factors included rural residence (odds ratio [OR] = 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4, 2.9) and previous pregnancy loss (OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.2, 0.6). CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of congenital syphilis may be less effective among pregnant women with syphilis in South Carolina who have fewer prenatal care visits. Health care providers need further education on maternal/child syphilis management and techniques for motivating and educating patients.},

From 2002 to 2012, 2,441,237 pregnant women were screened and screening coverage reached 97.2 % in 2012. In the background of continuing growth of CS in China, CS in Shenzhen significantly decreased from 109.3 cases in 2002 to 9.9 cases in 2012 per 100,000 live births. Maternal education (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]CS = 0.65; aORAPOs = 0.79) and history of syphilis (aORCS = 0.28; aORAPOs = 0.61), as well as paternal age (aORCS = 0.62; aORAPOs = 0.86) and education (aORCS = 0.66; aORAPOs = 0.86) were negatively associated with CS and APOs, but maternal unmarried status (aORCS = 1.95; aORAPOs = 2.61), inadequate antenatal care (ANC) (aORCS = 3.61; aORAPOs = 1.79), more sexual partners (aORCS = 1.51; aORAPOs = 1.39), every week of delay in treatment (aORCS = 2.82; aORAPOs = 1.27), higher baseline titers of nontreponemal antibodies (aORCS = 5.65; aORAPOs = 1.47), early syphilis (aORCS = 23.24; aORAPOs = 26.95), and non-penicillin treatment (aORCS = 3.00; aORAPOs = 2.16), as well as paternal history of cocaine use (aORCS = 2.70; aORAPOs = 2.44) and positive (aORCS = 4.14; aORAPOs = 1.50) or unknown (aORCS = 2.37; aORAPOs = 2.06) status of syphilis increased the risk of CS and APOs. Condom use (aOR = 0.70) decreased MTCT of syphilis. A ten-year program consisting of screening and treatment, early ANC, health education, partners tracking, detection, and treatment, follow-up visits, and information management is an effective means to block MTCT of syphilis. Maternal and paternal factors constituted two separate profiles associated with MTCT of syphilis.},

	abstract = {There are significant disparities in HIV acquisition, with Black individuals facing disproportionately more new diagnoses. Per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), all people aged 13-64 should be tested at least once in their lifetime, and men at increased risk (e.g., those who have male sexual contact, multiple partners, have partners with multiple partners, or share drug injection equipment) should be tested annually. The study included young Black men who have sex with women (MSW), aged 15-26, and who live in New Orleans, LA. Survey data was used to elicit the frequency and factors associated with three self-reported outcomes: (1) history of ever HIV testing, (2) HIV screening in the last year among those who were recommended per CDC, and (3) HIV positivity. Of the 1321 men included, 694/1321 men (52.5%) reported ever having been HIV tested. There were 708/1321 (54.2%) men who met the recommendation for annual screening and 321/708 (45.3%) of these eligible men reported being tested in the previous year. Of those ever tested, 44/694 (6.3%) self-reported testing positive. In logistic regression analysis, older age (OR: 1.27, p < 0.001), prior STI testing (OR: 6.45, p < 0.001), and prior incarceration (OR:1.70, p = 0.006) were positively associated with having ever received an HIV test, and ever having a male partner (OR: 3.63, p = 0.014) was associated with HIV positivity. Initiatives to improve HIV testing rates among young Black men who have sex with women are needed to reduce the burden of HIV and help the End the Epidemic initiative.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, there has been a marked resurgence of syphilis in the United States despite the availability of effective treatments and previously reliable prevention strategies. The majority of cases are among the population of men who have sex with men (MSM); however, there has also been a recent increase among premenopausal women, coinciding with a concerning rise of congenital cases. The resurgence of syphilis can be largely attributed to changing social and behavioral factors, especially among young MSM. The biological association of syphilis with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission and acquisition is particularly alarming because of the increased individual and healthcare burden. In addition, some individual actions and public health efforts that are meant to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV may actually lead to risk compensation that facilitates the transmission of syphilis. Untreated syphilis is associated with detrimental health outcomes; therefore, both effective prevention strategies and treatment of this systemic disease have important short-term and long-term public health implications. This article offers a review of social and behavioral factors contributing to the current resurgence and recommendations for reducing syphilis incidence through medical and public health prevention strategies.},

METHODS: Medical records were reviewed, pregnant women with syphilis were interviewed, and prenatal care providers were surveyed. RESULTS: Of 91 women, 59 (65%) had infants with congenital syphilis. Among African Americans, the prevalence per 1000 live births was 24.1 in 1994 and 17.9 in 1995. Of the 50 women with at least 2 prenatal care visits who had infants with congenital syphilis, 15 (30%) had received inadequate testing. Only 16% of 31 providers obtained an early third-trimester syphilis test on all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Inadequate prenatal testing contributed to this outbreak of congenital syphilis.},

@article{TaoEtAl:2014,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Female sex workers (FSWs) play a critical role in the heterosexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in China. Several studies reported that street-based FSWs have higher risk behaviors than establishment-based FSWs. Therefore, street-based FSWs should be specifically targeted for HIV and STIs intervention programs. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the prevalence rates and risk factors of HIV and syphilis among FSWs in Nanchang, China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using convenience sampling methods, 361 street-based FSWs were recruited from August 2011 to February 2012. All participants completed an anonymous questionnaire on socioeconomic and sex behavioral information and were tested for HIV and syphilis. Risk for HIV and syphilis infection was assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: No HIV infections were found. The prevalence rate of syphilis was 43.5%. Nearly 46.1% of street-based FSWs reported having education for no more than 6 years. Having reproductive tract infections at current visit, duration of sex work more than 5 years, indulgence in unprotected sex trade in the last time, unprotected sex trade in the last month, and unprotected sex with boyfriend or spouse in the last month were reported by 35.2%, 43.5%, 33.8%, 60.4%, and 93.1% street-based FSWs, respectively. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, having reproductive tract infections at current visit [odds ratio (OR), 12.10; 95% confidence interval (CI), 6.01-24.37], duration of sex work more than five years (OR, 4.26; 95% CI, 2.40-7.54), and unprotected sex trade in the last month (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.06-3.22) were independently associated with syphilis infection. CONCLUSION: The prevalence rate of syphilis among street-based FSWs is very high. Most street-based FSWs in our survey had low education, long experience of commercial sex, and high rate of inconsistent condom use. Comprehensive interventions targeting this high-risk group, especially scaling up screening and ensuring consistent use of condoms during sex are needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Congenital syphilis incidence has more than tripled in recent years, in parallel with the resurgence of syphilis among reproductive-aged women. An understanding of risk factors associated with maternal syphilis infection can guide prevention of congenital syphilis through prenatal diagnosis and treatment. We aimed to describe factors associated with maternal syphilis and congenital syphilis at a public medical center in Chicago, Illinois. METHODS: Maternal syphilis diagnoses were identified using a database for local health department reporting. Medical records were reviewed for infant congenital syphilis diagnoses, sociodemographic information, medical history, and other behavioral factors. Maternal characteristics associated with congenital syphilis were assessed using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 106 maternal syphilis diagnoses between 2014 and 2018, 76 (72%) had a known pregnancy outcome; of these, 8 (11%) delivered an infant with congenital syphilis. Women with psychiatric illness and noninjection substance use each had a >5-fold increased odds of having an infant with congenital syphilis. Cases with congenital syphilis were more likely to have late or scant prenatal care and initiated treatment nearly 3 months later in pregnancy. None were human immunodeficiency virus positive or reported incarceration, intravenous substance use, sex work, or having sex with men who have sex with men. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal psychiatric illness and substance use may have complicated prenatal care and delayed syphilis treatment, describing a population in need of public health intervention. Women experiencing such barriers to care may benefit from closer follow-up after a prenatal syphilis diagnosis to prevent congenital transmission.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The WHO Global Health Sector Strategy aims to reduce worldwide syphilis incidence by 90% between 2018 and 2030. If this goal is to be achieved, interventions that target high-burden groups, including men who have sex with men (MSM), will be required. However, there are no global prevalence estimates of syphilis among MSM to serve as a baseline for monitoring or modelling disease burden. We aimed to assess the global prevalence of syphilis among MSM using the available literature. METHODS: In this global systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and AIM databases, and Integrated Bio-Behavioral Surveillance (IBBS) reports between April 23, 2019, and Feb 1, 2020, to identify studies done between Jan 1, 2000, and Feb 1, 2020, with syphilis point prevalence data measured by biological assay among MSM (defined as people who were assigned as male at birth and had oral or anal sex with at least one other man in their lifetime). Studies were excluded if participants were exclusively HIV-infected MSM, injection-drug users, only seeking care for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or genital symptoms, or routine STI clinic attendees. Data were extracted onto standardised forms and cross-checked for accuracy and validity. We used random-effects models to generate pooled prevalence estimates across the eight regions of the Sustainable Development Goals. We calculated risk of study bias based on the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies, and stratified results based on low versus high risk of bias. This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019144594. FINDINGS: We reviewed 4339 records, 228 IBBS reports, and ten articles from other sources. Of these, 1301 duplicate records were excluded, 2467 records were excluded after title and abstract screening, and 534 articles were excluded after full-text analysis. We identified 345 prevalence data points from 275 studies across 77 countries, with a total of 606 232 participants. Global pooled prevalence from 2000-20 was 7.5% (95% CI 7.0-8.0%), ranging from 1.9% (1.0-3.1%) in Australia and New Zealand to 10.6% (8.5-12.9%) in Latin America and the Caribbean. INTERPRETATION: Unacceptably high syphilis prevalence among MSM warrants urgent action. FUNDING: Wellcome Trust.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite recent declines in syphilis rates nationally, recent outbreaks suggest that prevention of congenital syphilis remains an ongoing public health problem. GOALS: To identify missed opportunities for congenital syphilis prevention during prenatal care. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective medical record review of 157 live birth or stillbirth deliveries that involved cases of congenital syphilis from Grady Memorial Hospital (Atlanta, GA). RESULTS: The hospital congenital syphilis prevalence was 8.2 cases per 1,000 live births. Six percent of case patients were HIV positive. Opportunities for earlier maternal screening, treatment, or diagnosis were missed in 60% of case patients who received timely prenatal care. Congenital syphilis cases attributable to preventable missed opportunities were significantly more common among case patients with fewer prenatal visits (66% versus 28%, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Provider efforts to reduce congenital syphilis in high-risk populations receiving prenatal care should focus on (1) screening patients at the first opportunity, at both the first prenatal visit and during the third trimester (i.e., 28 weeks); (2) performing on-site testing and same-day treatment; (3) providing appropriate treatment to infected women with penicillin allergy; (4) referring sex partners for treatment to prevent reinfection; and (5) screening all pregnant women attending emergency clinics.},
