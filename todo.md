Richard:
* Re-derive the Novozhilov formula using the Romanescu approach
* Derive a negative binomial formula in parallel with above
	* Does it make sense?
	* Does it match Romanescu's geometric formula??

Jonathan:
* Write down a simple derivation of the Zhao formula
* Write what you can about the justification and what might be missing
* Does this help us move in the direction of the Romanescu calculations?
