## Heterogeneous/Variable Susceptibility Model

More model details in  [A. Montalban, RM. Corder and MGM. Gomes(2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00285-022-01771-x)

Assuming
1.  random mixing
2. heterogeneous susceptibility with continuous trait $x$ where the susceptibility of an individual at level $x$ is proportional to $x$
	- In other words, if we compare an individual at level $x$ and an individual at level $y$, the one at level $x$ is $x/y$ times more likely to get infected than the one with susceptibility $y$.

- $x$ is the individual susceptibility to infection in relation to the mean
- $q(x)$ is the continuous distribution with mean $\int x q(x) dx=1$.
- $q(x)$ is parameterized by coefficient of variation(CV) $v=\sqrt{\int (x-1)^2 q(x) dx}$ =stdv of $x$.
- $\lambda$ is the average force of infection, such that $$\lambda=\frac{\beta}{N}\int (\rho E(x,t)+I(x,t))dx=\frac{\beta}{N}(\rho E(t)+I(t))$$
- $\rho$ is the infectiousness ratio factor of $E$ comparing to $I$
- $\delta$ is the processing rate from $E$ to $I$
- $\phi$ is the proportion of death due to COVID/the disease

They created an SEIR model such that for each "trait" $x$, an equivalent PDE system is given by
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial S(x,t)}{\partial t} & = -\lambda x S(x,t)
\\
\frac{\partial E(x,t)}{\partial t} & = +\lambda x S(x,t)-\delta E(x,t)
\\
\frac{\partial I(x,t)}{\partial t} & = +\delta E(x,t)-\gamma I(x,t)
\\
\frac{\partial R(x,t)}{\partial t} & = +(1-\phi)\gamma I(x,t) 
\end{align}
$$
==In infection term, both connectivity and infectiousness is homogeneous. And all other dynamic quantities are also homogeneous.==

While the basic reproductive number is given by $$\mathcal{R}_0=\beta(\frac{\rho}{\delta}+\frac{1}{\gamma})$$
Additionally, they defined $\mathcal{R}_c$ to reflect impact of time varying factors (e.g. NPIs, behavior changes, seasonality and pathogen evolution) to reproductive number, such that$$\mathcal{R}_c=c(t)\times\mathcal{R}_0$$
- $c(t) > 0$ describes the risk of infection at time $t$ in relation to baseline, reflecting the impact of control/intervention to infection/transmission event.

They follow [Novozhilov(2008)](./refs/Novozhilov2008.pdf) and derive the SEIR version of Novozhilov, also assuming that $q(x)$ is Gamma distribution. Then the ODE system for 
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{d S}{dt} & = -\beta (\rho E+I)(\frac{S}{N})^{1+v^2}
\\
\frac{d E}{dt} & = +\beta (\rho E+I)(\frac{S}{N})^{1+v^2}-\delta E
\\
\frac{d I}{dt} & = +\delta E -\gamma I
\\
\frac{d R}{dt} & = +(1-\phi)\gamma I 
\end{align}
$$
This is equivalent of [Novozhilov(2008)](./refs/Novozhilov2008.pdf) result as $p=1+v^2$ for $S^p$.
- They take $S(0)=S_0=1$
### Effective Reproduction Number, Herd Immunity Threshold(HIT) and Epidemic Final Size(EFS) 
The effective reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}}(t)$ is a time-dependent quantity loosely defined as the number of secondary infections generated by a typical infected individual when the susceptibility of the population is $S(t)$ at time t.

As a derivation of their variable susceptibility model: $$\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}}(t)=\mathcal{R}_c(\frac{S(t)}{N})^{1+v^2}=c(t)\mathcal{R}_0(\frac{S(t)}{N})^{1+v^2}$$
The population is said to be at or above the ==**Herd Immunity Threshold(HIT)**== for a pathogen if its susceptibility profile ($S$) to that pathogen is such that a new introduction of infection (i.e., a small increase in E or I) does not trigger an outbreak. 
In this model, HIT is reached if where $$\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}} \leq 1$$
If only consider natural infection (i.e. no intervention) such that $c(t) \equiv 1$, then the HIT is given by $$\mathcal{H}= 1-(\frac{1}{\mathcal{R}_0})^{\frac{1}{1+v^2}}$$
- If $S(t) \leq \mathcal{H}$ new epidemic outbreak will not happen naturally if pathogen is re-introduce to the population.
- For homogeneous model, $$\mathcal{H}= 1-(\frac{1}{\mathcal{R}_0})$$
The final infected size $R(\infty)$ is given implicitly by $$(1-R(\infty))^{v^2}(v^2 \mathcal{R}_0 R(\infty)+1)=1$$

## Heterogeneous/Variable Connectivity Model

For this model, they also name it as "variation in exposure to infection" in [MGM. Gomes,EtAl.(2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2022.111063).

They are ==not using any network/graph approach== to modeling heterogenous connectivity, just simply assume
1. random mixing 
2. heterogeneous connectivity with same continuous trait $x$
	- i.e. an individual at level $x$ to acquire infection and transmit to others are both proportional to $x$.
This is beyond the [Novozhilov(2008)](./refs/Novozhilov2008.pdf) framework, which assume infectee inherit infectivity trait from infector. But it is indeed closer to network idea.

Comparing the PDE system of Heterogeneous/Variable susceptibility model, the changes is the average force of infection: $$\lambda=\frac{\beta}{N}\frac{\int x(\rho E(x,t)+I(x,t))dx}{\int x q(x)dx}=\frac{\beta}{N}\int x(\rho E(x,t)+I(x,t))dx$$
The traits are now inherited to $E,I,R$ class but not affect the parameters. They introduce new notation for the first/second moments of $S(x,t), E(x,t), I(x,t), R(x,t)$ such that $$\begin{align}
\bar{S}(t) & = \int xS(x,t)dx \text{~and~} \bar{\bar{S}}(t) = \int x^2S(x,t)dx
\\
\bar{E}(t) & = \int xE(x,t)dx
\\
\bar{I}(t) & = \int xI(x,t)dx
\\
\bar{R}(t) & = \int xR(x,t)dx 
\end{align}$$
Assume Gamma distribution for $q(x)$ again, they derive that $$\begin{align}
\bar{S}(t) & =\int x S(x,t)dx=S(t)^{1+v^2}
\\
\bar{\bar{S}}(t) & =\int x^2 S(x,t)dx=S(t)^{1+2v^2}
\end{align}$$
With the ODE system based on moments:
$$\begin{align}
\frac{d \bar{S}}{dt} & = -\beta (\rho \bar{E}+\bar{I})(\frac{\bar{\bar{S}}}{N})=-(1+v^2)\beta (\rho \bar{E}+\bar{I})(\frac{\bar{S}}{N})^\frac{1+2v^2}{1+v^2}
\\
\frac{d \bar{E}}{dt} & = +\beta (\rho \bar{E}+\bar{I})(\frac{\bar{\bar{S}}}{N})-\delta \bar{E}=+(1+v^2)\beta (\rho \bar{E}+\bar{I})(\frac{\bar{S}}{N})^\frac{1+2v^2}{1+v^2}-\delta \bar{E}
\\
\frac{d \bar{I}}{dt} & = +\delta \bar{E} -\gamma \bar{I}
\\
\frac{d \bar{R}}{dt} & = +(1-\phi)\gamma \bar{I}
\end{align}$$
They claim that if the duration of infectious $\tau$ is
