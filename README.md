## simulator info

* `NetSimulator.cpp` is a vertex-based simulator 
* `edgelist.cpp` is an edge-based simulator
* `scaleExamples.R` is set up to use *either* machinery, based on what's in the Makefile: compare `scaleEdges.Rout` with `scaleExamples.Rout`. `compareSims.R` (not yet plumbed) is the beginning of machinery to compare the two approaches.
